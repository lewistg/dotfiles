# README

This repository contains my dot files.

I recommend using the "git --bare" method of managing dot files. Credit to
@duran for documenting this method in [this][1] tutorial. Following this
method, you can install the dot files on a new machine using the
[`.dotfiles/install.sh`][2] script like so:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewistg/dotfiles/master/.dotfiles/install.sh | bash
```
